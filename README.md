# Work Day Scheduler

This scheduling website can be used to help you plan your work day.

Access the deployed application <a href="https://mrsdno.github.io/work-day-scheduler/">here</a>.

## How to Use

* To use this scheduler, simply click the box next to the time you would like to schedule.
* After typing in the input box, click the save button to save the task to you machine's local storage.
* When you refresh or leave the page, the task will still be saved. You will need to clear the previous day's tasks each morning.

## Time Tracking

* The website also will track the time. 
* The current time will be red, so you know what you should be working on now. 
* Times in the past will be green so you know what you should have completed already.
* Times in the future will be gray.
